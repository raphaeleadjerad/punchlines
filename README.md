# Text mining punchline

*Work in progress*

This project uses `lyricsgenius`[see here](https://pypi.org/project/lyricsgenius/0.3/) and 
the Genius API to retrieve lyrics
from rap songs with the word `punchline` (this or other forms) in it. 

The interesting thing is the fact that it uses lyrics from different languages,
hence after tokenizing, we have to use stop words and stemming adapted to each language.


Project done for my brother.
